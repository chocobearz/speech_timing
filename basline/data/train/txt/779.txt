Good morning everyone. Today I want to talk about the importance of taking care of our environment. We all know that pollution is a major issue that we are facing today, but what we don't realize is that it's not just affecting our air and water quality. The destruction of our environment is also having a negative effect on our mental and physical health. 

We are exposed to more toxins, pollutants, and chemicals than ever before, and this is causing a rise in cancer rates and other diseases. Additionally, the destruction of our natural environment, such as forests and coral reefs, is causing a decrease in biodiversity, which is essential for our survival. 

The good news is that there are many things that we can do to help protect our environment. We can reduce our carbon footprint by driving less and using renewable energy sources. We can also reduce our waste by recycling and composting. Finally, we can support organizations that are working to protect our environment and make sure that our voices are heard. 

Taking care of our environment is essential for our health and wellbeing. We must take action now to protect our planet for future generations. Thank you for listening.

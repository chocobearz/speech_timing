We all have the ability to make a difference in our lives and the lives of others. Whether it’s something as simple as a smile or an act of kindness, or something more significant like starting a charity or running for office, each of us has the power to create positive change in our world. 

But too often, we don’t take action. We get caught up in our daily routines and it’s easy to forget that we can make a difference. 

So, I urge you to take a few minutes each day to think about how you can make a difference. It doesn’t have to be a huge gesture – it can be something small. Maybe it’s writing a letter to your local representative about an issue you care about, or simply lending a helping hand to someone in need. 

No matter what it is, you have the power to make a difference. So, let’s use it. Let’s use our power to create a better world for ourselves and for future generations.

We all have moments when we feel like we just don't have enough time to get everything done. But if we take a step back and look at how we're spending our time, we can make small changes that add up to big improvements. For example, instead of spending an hour scrolling through social media, try setting a timer and limiting yourself to just 15 minutes. Or instead of having lunch with friends every day, try to meet up every other day instead. Making small changes like this can help us to make the most of our time and help us to achieve our goals.

We all have a unique story to tell, and I'm here to tell you that our stories matter. Whether we’re talking about our personal experiences or the stories of our families and communities, these stories have the power to shape our lives and the world around us. They can inspire us to take action, to make a difference, and to find common ground.

The stories we tell can also help us to build understanding and empathy. By listening to each other’s stories, we can gain a better understanding of our own experiences and those of others. We can learn to recognize our shared humanity, and find ways to work together to create a better world.

So, I encourage you to tell your stories. Share them with your friends, your family, and your community. Tell them to the world. Our stories can make a difference, and together we can create a better future. Thank you.

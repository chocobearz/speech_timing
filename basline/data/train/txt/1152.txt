We all want to make a difference in the world. Whether it's through our careers, our hobbies, or our families, we want to leave a lasting impact. But how do we do that? How do we make sure that the work we do is meaningful? 

The answer is simple: focus on the small. We can't expect to have a large impact overnight. Instead, we should focus on the small things that we can do that will add up to something bigger. We can volunteer our time at a local charity, help a neighbor in need, or donate to a cause we care about. 

These small acts of kindness may not seem like much, but they can have a lasting impact. They can be the difference between someone having a bad day and having a good day. They can be the difference between someone feeling alone and feeling connected. They can be the difference between someone feeling hopeless and feeling hopeful. 

The power of the small should not be underestimated. It may seem insignificant in the moment, but it can have a lasting effect. So let's all make a commitment to focus on the small and make a difference in our world.

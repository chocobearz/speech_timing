But in those moments, it's important to remember that we are capable of so much more than we think. We have the power to take control of our lives and make a positive impact on the world. It's important to remember that we are more than our circumstances. We have the power to make change, and that power is within all of us. So when you feel like you're losing control, take a step back and remember that you have the power to make a difference.

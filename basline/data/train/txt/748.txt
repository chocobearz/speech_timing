If you’ve ever felt like you don’t have the courage to do something, I want to tell you that you do. Courage is not something that you are born with, it is something that you have to build. It takes practice, and it takes time. But, if you are willing to put in the effort, you can build the courage you need to take on whatever challenge life throws at you.

Courage is not about being fearless. It’s about having the strength to face your fears and take risks. It’s about being brave enough to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new. It’s about having the confidence to stand up for what you believe in and make your voice heard.

Courage is not something that you can buy, it’s something that you have to work for. It’s something that you have to practice and cultivate. It’s something that you have to build every day, and it starts with small steps. So, take a deep breath, and take the first step. You have the courage within you, and you can do it.

We all want to feel like we’re making a difference in the world, but it can be hard to know where to start. I believe that the most powerful way to make a difference is to start with yourself. By taking the time to cultivate a greater understanding of yourself and your values, you can become more effective in your actions and more intentional in your decisions. When we take the time to understand ourselves, we can better understand the needs of those around us and how we can help them. It's not always easy, but the rewards of self-reflection and self-awareness are worth it. When we take the time to understand ourselves, we become more compassionate and empathetic, and we can make a greater impact on the lives of others.

When we are mindful, we can observe our emotions and thoughts without getting stuck in them. We can be aware of our thoughts and feelings without getting overwhelmed by them.

By practicing mindfulness, we can gain perspective on our lives and recognize when we are feeling overwhelmed. We can also take steps to make positive changes in our lives, such as taking a break from a stressful situation or talking to a friend for support. 

Mindfulness is a powerful tool to help us stay grounded and gain control in times of stress. It can help us to recognize when we are feeling overwhelmed and take steps to make positive changes. With practice, mindfulness can become a regular part of our lives and help us to stay focused and productive.

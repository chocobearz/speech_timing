The power of storytelling is often overlooked, but it can be a powerful tool to share knowledge, create connections, and inspire change. Stories can provide an entry point to difficult conversations, allowing us to explore and understand complex topics in a way that is both engaging and meaningful. Stories can also help us to empathize with others, allowing us to see the world through a different perspective. By understanding each other’s stories, we can create a more inclusive and equitable world. In short, stories can help us to bridge divides, build understanding, and create a better future.

We all have moments in life when we feel like we don't belong. We feel like we're in a place that doesn't quite fit us, like a square peg in a round hole. It's easy to get stuck in these moments, feeling like we don't have the power to make a change. But the truth is that we do have the power to make a change. We can step out of our comfort zones and find a place that fits us better. We can create a new identity and a new home. We can find a place where we belong. All it takes is a little courage to take that first step. So don't be afraid to take that leap, to find a place that fits you better. You have the power to make a change and create a new home.

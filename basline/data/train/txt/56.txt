We all have moments when we feel like giving up. When we feel like our goals are too far out of reach and the path to achieving them is too hard. But if we can find the courage to keep going, to keep pushing forward, then we can find success. We can reach our goals and create a life that we are proud of. 

The key to finding this courage is to focus on the progress we have made, rather than the distance we have yet to go. Celebrate the small victories and use them to propel us forward. Acknowledge the challenges and the hard work it took to get to where we are. Find the strength in that and use it to keep going.

By focusing on the progress we have made, we can gain the courage to keep going. We can find the strength to push through the hard times and achieve our goals. We can create a life that we are proud of. So the next time you feel like giving up, remember to focus on the progress you have made. It will give you the courage to keep going.

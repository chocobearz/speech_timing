We all have the potential to make a difference in the world. The only thing stopping us is our own self-doubt and fear of failure. We have to push ourselves out of our comfort zone and take risks in order to make a meaningful impact. We can't let our fear of the unknown hold us back from achieving our goals. We have to be brave and take the first step to make a difference. We can start small and take baby steps, but eventually, we can make a big difference. So don't be afraid to take risks and make a difference in the world.

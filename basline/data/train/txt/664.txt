We all have moments in our lives where we feel overwhelmed, stressed and anxious. But what if I told you that there is a way to reduce the intensity and frequency of these feelings? The answer is mindfulness. Mindfulness is a practice of focusing your attention on the present moment, while accepting and observing your thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations without judgment. When practiced regularly, it can help us to become more aware of our thoughts and feelings, and to respond to them in healthier ways. Research has shown that mindfulness can reduce stress, anxiety and depression, as well as improve our physical health. It can also help us to become more self-aware and to live in the present moment, rather than worrying about the future or ruminating on the past. So, if you're feeling overwhelmed, try taking a few moments to practice mindfulness. It can make a world of difference!

We all have moments in our lives when we feel like we don’t have control. Whether it’s a difficult situation, a challenging relationship, or a problem we can’t seem to solve, it can be hard to feel like we have any power. But the truth is, no matter how powerless we may feel, we always have the power to choose how we respond. 

When faced with a difficult situation, we can choose to react with fear and anxiety, or we can choose to respond with courage and strength. When faced with a challenging relationship, we can choose to respond with anger and resentment, or we can choose to respond with compassion and understanding. And when faced with a problem we can’t seem to solve, we can choose to give up, or we can choose to keep trying. 

No matter how powerless we may feel, we always have the power to choose how we respond. So the next time you find yourself in a difficult situation, remember that you have the power to choose how you respond. Choose courage, choose strength, choose compassion, and choose to keep trying. You may not be able to control the situation, but you can control how you respond to it.

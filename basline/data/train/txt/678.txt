We all know the saying, “It takes a village to raise a child.” But what if I told you that it takes more than just a village to raise a child? It takes a whole community. A community of people who are willing to come together to create a safe, nurturing, and supportive environment for children to grow and thrive. We need to be intentional about creating these environments in our communities. We need to be proactive in making sure that our children have access to the resources they need to succeed. We need to create a culture of collaboration and support amongst our neighbors, schools, churches, and other organizations. We need to come together to ensure that our children have the best possible start in life. Let’s work together to create a community that is invested in our children’s future and willing to invest in their success.

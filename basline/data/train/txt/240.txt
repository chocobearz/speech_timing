We all have the power to make a difference. We can start small, by making small changes in our lives that can have a big impact. We can choose to use reusable bags instead of plastic ones, or turn off the lights when we leave a room. We can also make a difference in our communities by volunteering our time or donating to causes we care about. And we can use our voices to bring attention to issues that are important to us. Every one of us has the potential to make a positive difference in the world, and when we work together, our collective impact can be even greater.

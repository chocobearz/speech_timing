 We all have moments in life when we feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and like we can't go on. But I believe that if we can find the courage to keep going, no matter how hard it may seem, we can find the strength to overcome any obstacle.  When I was a child, I was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that left me in constant pain. I was told I would never be able to do the things I wanted to do, like play sports or go to school. But I refused to accept that. I worked hard to find ways to manage my pain and eventually, I was able to do the things I wanted to do. This experience taught me that no matter how difficult something may seem, if you keep going and never give up, you can achieve anything. I believe that if we can find the courage to keep going, even when the odds are stacked against us, we can find strength to overcome any obstacle. So, the next time you feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and like you can't go on, remember that you have the power to keep going and find the strength to overcome any challenge.

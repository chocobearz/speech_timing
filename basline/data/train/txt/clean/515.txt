 Good morning everyone. Today I want to talk to you about the importance of self care. We all have busy lives and it can be hard to find time for ourselves, but it is essential to our wellbeing. Self care is about taking the time to look after your physical, mental and emotional health. It can be anything from going for a walk, to reading a book or even just taking a few moments to sit in silence. It's important to remember that self care isn't selfish, it's necessary. When we take the time to look after ourselves, we become better able to take care of the people and things that matter to us. So make sure to take care of yourself, because you deserve it. Thank you.

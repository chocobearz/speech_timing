 Good morning everyone. Today I'm here to talk to you about the power of optimism and how it can help us reach our goals.  Optimism is the belief that good things will happen and that the future will be better than the present. It is a positive outlook on life that can help us to stay motivated and focused on our goals. Optimism can help us to overcome obstacles and stay resilient in the face of challenges.  When we are optimistic, we are more likely to take risks and push ourselves out of our comfort zones. We are also more likely to take initiative and be creative in our problem solving. Optimism gives us the courage to try new things and to take risks that could potentially lead to great rewards.  Optimism also helps us to stay positive and focused on the present. We are more likely to appreciate the good things that are happening right now, rather than worrying about the future. This can help us to stay productive and motivated to achieve our goals.  In conclusion, optimism is a powerful tool that can help us to stay focused and motivated on our goals. It can help us to overcome obstacles and take risks that could potentially lead to great rewards. So let's all strive to be more optimistic and to use it to help us reach our goals. Thank you.

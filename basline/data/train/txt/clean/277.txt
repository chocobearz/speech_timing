 We all want to live in a world where we can make a difference. We want to be part of something bigger than ourselves, something that will make a lasting impact. But how do we make that happen?  The answer is simple: start small. Small acts of kindness, compassion, and understanding can have a huge ripple effect. One act of kindness can start a chain reaction that can spread around the world.  For instance, if you take the time to help someone in need, that person may then be inspired to help someone else, and so on. This is how we can create positive change in our communities and the world.  So the next time you have the opportunity to do something kind, take it. You never know what kind of difference it could make. Even the smallest act can have a lasting impact.

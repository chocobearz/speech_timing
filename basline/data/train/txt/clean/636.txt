 As we move forward into the future, technology is becoming more and more integrated into our lives. We are becoming increasingly dependent on technology for our day to day activities and tasks. But with this dependency comes a responsibility to use technology responsibly and ethically. We must ensure that technology is used to improve our lives, not to harm others or create an unbalanced society. We must also be aware of the potential dangers of technology, such as cyber security threats, data privacy issues, and the potential for technology to be used for malicious purposes. We must be proactive in addressing these issues, and ensure that technology is used for the betterment of society. By doing so, we can make sure that technology is used to create a better world for everyone.

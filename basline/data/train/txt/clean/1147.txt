 We all have the power to create change. Whether it's in our own lives or in our communities, the power of collective action is a force for good. But to make a real difference, we need to understand the root causes of the problems we face. We need to ask questions and listen to the answers. We need to think critically and act creatively. We need to be open to new ideas and to taking risks. We need to be willing to collaborate and to challenge the status quo. We need to be persistent and patient, and most of all, we need to have faith in ourselves and in each other. Together, we can create a better world.

 We all know that technology has changed our lives in many ways. But what many of us don't realize is how much it has changed the way we think and interact with each other. Our minds have been rewired to think and act differently, and this has had a huge impact on our social lives. The way we communicate with each other has shifted dramatically in the past decade. We are now more likely to send a text or an email than to pick up the phone and call. We are more likely to be on social media than to meet up with friends in person. We are more likely to scroll through our news feeds than to read a newspaper. These changes in our communication habits have had a profound effect on how we interact with one another. We now have a much broader circle of acquaintances, but our relationships are often more shallow. We are more likely to share our opinions and experiences with a wide audience, but we are less likely to really get to know each other. Technology has changed the way we think and interact with each other, and it is up to us to decide how to use it. We can choose to use it to stay connected and informed, or we can choose to use it to disconnect and become isolated. We can use it to cultivate meaningful relationships, or we can use it to create superficial ones. The choice is ours.

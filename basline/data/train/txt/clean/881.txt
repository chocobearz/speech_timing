 Good morning everyone. Today I'm going to talk about the power of storytelling. Stories have been used for centuries to entertain, educate, and inspire. But what makes stories so powerful? I believe the power of storytelling lies in its ability to connect us all. Whether it's a story about a family, a community, or a culture, we can all find something to relate to. Stories can also help us to understand different perspectives, and even empathize with characters that we may not agree with. Stories also have the power to move us emotionally. We can laugh, cry, and feel joy when we hear a story that resonates with us. That's why stories are such a powerful tool for communication. Finally, stories can inspire us to take action. They can motivate us to make changes in our lives, or to fight for a cause that we believe in. So the next time you hear a story, take a moment to reflect on the power that it holds. Think about how it can connect us, move us, and inspire us. That's the power of storytelling. Thank you.

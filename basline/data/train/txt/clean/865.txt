 Good morning everyone. Today I want to talk to you about the power of resilience. Resilience is the ability to stay strong and optimistic in the face of adversity. It's the ability to keep going even when things don't go as planned. Resilience is an incredibly important trait to have in life. It helps us stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when we face challenges. It's what enables us to bounce back from setbacks and keep going. Resilience is something that we all have within us, but it's also something that we can cultivate. We can learn to be more resilient by developing a growth mindset and engaging in positive self talk. We can also look to role models who have been resilient in the face of adversity and draw inspiration from them. Resilience is a key ingredient for success in life. It's what will help us stay motivated and keep going even when things don't go our way. So let's all make an effort to cultivate our resilience and stay strong in the face of adversity. Thank you.

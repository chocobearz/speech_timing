 Good morning! Today I want to talk to you about the power of just starting. We all have dreams and goals that we want to achieve. But often, it can be difficult to take the first step. We can be overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done, or we can be too scared to take the risk. But I'm here to tell you that the best way to get started is to just start. No matter how small the step, taking action is the key to success. It's easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis, where we think and plan and research, but never actually do anything. But if you just start, you will be able to build momentum and make progress. You don't have to have all the answers. You don't have to have a detailed plan. You just have to take the first step. Starting is the key to unlocking your potential and achieving your dreams. So, just start. Thank you.

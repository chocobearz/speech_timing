 We all have the power to make a difference in the world. We may not always realize it, but we are capable of making a positive impact in our own lives, the lives of those around us, and even in the lives of those we may never meet. We can start by taking small steps in our day to day lives â€“ from picking up litter in our communities to volunteering our time and energy to local causes. We can also make a difference by simply being kind to one another, listening to understand, and speaking up when we see injustice. Every action we take, no matter how small, can have a ripple effect that can make a huge difference in the world. So let's make a commitment to use our power to make the world a better place.

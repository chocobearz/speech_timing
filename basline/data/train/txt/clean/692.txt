 As we move forward in our lives, it's important to remember that we are all connected. We are connected to our families, our friends, our communities, and the world. We each have a responsibility to do our part to make the world a better place. This can look like something small, like picking up litter in your neighborhood, or something larger, like volunteering for an organization that works to address global issues. No matter what it looks like, it's important to remember that we're all connected and that our actions can have an impact. We all can make a difference, and it starts with each of us.

 Good morning everyone! Today I want to talk to you about the power of small actions. We often think of great accomplishments as grand gestures, but I believe that small actions can have a huge impact. Take for example the story of a young woman who wanted to make a difference in her community. She started small, by picking up trash in her neighborhood every day. It wasn't glamorous, but it made a difference. Soon, her neighbors joined in and started helping out. Before long, the whole community was working together to make their neighborhood a better place. This is just one example of how small actions can lead to big changes. Even the smallest actions can have a ripple effect that can lead to a better world. So, the next time you're looking to make a difference, don't be afraid to start small. You never know what kind of impact your actions can have. Thank you.

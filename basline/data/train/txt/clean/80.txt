 When it comes to achieving success, it's easy to focus on what we don't have. We can be so focused on the end result that we forget to enjoy the journey. But it's important to remember that success isn't just about achieving a goal; it's about the process of getting there. It's about the effort we put in, the mistakes we make, and the lessons we learn along the way. Success is about the journey, not the destination.  When we focus on the journey, we can appreciate the small successes that come with it. We can learn to enjoy the process of learning and growing, and use that to propel us forward. We can be proud of our accomplishments, no matter how small. We can also learn to be resilient in the face of failure and use it as an opportunity to grow.  By shifting our focus to the journey, we can find success in the process and the small victories along the way. It's important to remember that it's not just about the end result; it's about the journey of getting there.

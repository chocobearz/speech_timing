 We all want to make a difference in the world, but sometimes it can be hard to know where to start. That's why I believe that the best way to make a difference is to start small and focus on what we can do in our own lives. We can make a difference by volunteering, speaking up for causes we care about, and helping our communities. We can also make a difference by supporting small, local businesses and making sure our spending reflects our values. Even the smallest acts of kindness can have a ripple effect and make a difference in the world. So let's all make a commitment to do our part and make a difference in the world, no matter how small.

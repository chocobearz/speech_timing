It's the capacity to handle adversity, to keep pushing forward, and to never give up.  Resilience is something that is often overlooked, but it's an essential quality to have in order to achieve success. It's the ability to keep going even when you feel like giving up. It's the capacity to handle adversity, to keep pushing forward, and to never give up. It's the determination to keep going even when the odds are against you. Resilience is something that we can all cultivate. It's a skill that can be developed over time. The more we practice resilience, the better we get at it. We can strengthen our resilience by taking time to reflect on our experiences and learn from them. We can also practice self care, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising. Resilience is a powerful tool that can help us achieve our goals and reach our full potential. So, let's all make an effort to cultivate our resilience and use it to reach our goals. Thank you.

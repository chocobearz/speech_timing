 We all want to make a difference in the world, but it can be hard to know where to start. The key is to start small and think big. Start by looking at the world around you and identifying a problem that needs to be solved. Then think of a creative solution to that problem. It doesn't have to be a grand solution. Even small changes can have a big impact. Once you have your solution, take action. Reach out to others who can help you make it happen. Whether it's through volunteering, fundraising, or starting a petition, there are plenty of ways to get involved and make a difference. Remember, it's the small steps we take that can lead to big changes. So start small and think big   because together, we can make a difference.

 We all have dreams and aspirations. But, too often, we become overwhelmed and discouraged by the obstacles that stand in our way. We become so focused on the difficulty of the journey that we forget why we set out on it in the first place. We forget our passion and our purpose.  My advice is to focus on the end goal, not the hurdles. Imagine the feeling of success and accomplishment you will have when you reach your destination. Visualize it and keep that feeling in your heart. This will help you stay motivated and push through the difficult times. Remember, nothing worth having comes easy. But the rewards are worth the effort. So, keep your eyes on the prize and don't give up. You can do it.

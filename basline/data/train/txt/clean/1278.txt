 We all know the feeling of being overwhelmed by life. We can feel like we don't have enough time, energy, or resources to accomplish everything we need to do. But instead of letting this feeling take over, I believe we should take a step back and focus on the things that we can control. We can't control the amount of time we have, but we can control how we manage it. We can prioritize our tasks and focus on the most important ones first. We can also break down our goals into smaller pieces, which can make them seem more manageable and less daunting.  We can't control the amount of energy we have, but we can control how we use it. We can practice self care and make sure we are taking care of our physical and mental health. We can also make sure we are getting enough rest and eating healthy. We can't control our resources, but we can control how we use them. We can be mindful of our spending and make sure we are using our resources wisely. We can also look for ways to save money and stretch our resources further. By focusing on the things that we can control, we can take back some of the power in our lives and feel more empowered. We can take control of our lives and make sure we are making the most of our time, energy, and resources.

We all want to live meaningful lives, but it can be hard to know where to start. One way to get started is to think about your values. What is important to you? What do you want your life to stand for? Once you have identified your values, you can start to make decisions that align with them. Your values can help you decide how to spend your time, who to spend it with, and what kind of work you want to do. They can also help you stay focused and motivated when times get tough. When you make decisions that are in line with your values, you can be sure that you are living a life that is true to who you are.

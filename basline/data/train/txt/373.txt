We all have the power to make a difference. We can start small, but the impact can be huge. We can join together and create a ripple effect that can change the world. We can choose to be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. We can bring light to dark places, and hope to those in despair. We can make a difference, one person at a time. 

It starts with each of us. We can choose to be kind and generous, to help those in need, to speak out against injustice. We can choose to be compassionate and understanding, to forgive and to listen. We can choose to be brave and stand up for what we believe in, to fight for those who can’t fight for themselves. 

We can choose to make a difference. We can choose to be the change we want to see in the world. We can choose to be a force for good, to be a beacon of hope. We can choose to make a difference, and together, we can create a better future.

We all have moments in our lives that define us, moments that shape us and help us to become who we are. But what if those defining moments were taken away from us? What if they were taken away before we even had the chance to experience them?

This is the reality for so many of the world’s youth. Every day, millions of children are denied the opportunity to experience the moments that will shape and define them. They are denied access to education, to healthcare, to basic human rights. They are denied the chance to reach their potential, to become who they were meant to be.

It is our responsibility as a global community to ensure that these children have the opportunity to experience their own moments of growth and transformation. We must do our part to provide them with the resources and support they need to reach their goals and to shape their own lives. We must work together to create a world in which every child can reach their potential and experience the moments that will define them.

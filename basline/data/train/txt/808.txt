We often think of success as a linear path, but that's not necessarily the case. Success is often a winding road, full of twists and turns. We may not always end up exactly where we thought we would, but that's okay. It's important to stay flexible and to be open to new opportunities. Even if something doesn't seem like it will lead to your end goal, it may still be beneficial. You never know where a new experience or connection may lead. Taking risks, trying new things, and learning along the way can all be part of the journey to success.

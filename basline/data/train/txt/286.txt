Good morning! Today I want to talk to you about the power of small acts of kindness. We often think of kindness as grand gestures, like donating a large sum of money to a charity or volunteering at a soup kitchen. But kindness doesn't have to be big to make a difference. Even the smallest acts of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's day.

For example, paying for someone's coffee in line behind you, holding the door open for someone, or simply smiling at someone can make a world of difference. These small acts of kindness can brighten someone's day and make them feel seen and appreciated.

I'm sure we've all experienced the power of small acts of kindness. Maybe someone paid for your coffee one day, or held the door open for you. Maybe someone smiled at you when you were feeling down. These moments can make us feel seen, heard, and appreciated.

So today, let's take a moment to think about how we can show kindness to those around us. Let's take the time to recognize and appreciate the small acts of kindness that we experience each day. Let's strive to be kind and generous to those around us, no matter how small the act may be.

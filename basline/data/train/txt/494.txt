Technology has changed the way we communicate, the way we work, and the way we live. It has revolutionized our lives and has made it easier to stay connected with friends and family all over the world. But technology can also be a double-edged sword. With the rise of social media, online bullying and cyber-stalking have become commonplace, and it can be difficult to protect ourselves and our children from these threats. That's why it is so important to be aware of the potential dangers that technology can bring and to take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones. By being informed, we can use technology to its fullest potential while staying safe.
